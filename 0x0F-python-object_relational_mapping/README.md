# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Project

Welcome to my Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project repository! This project is designed to deepen my understanding of ORM techniques using Python with MySQL databases. Below are the tasks and files included in this repository:

## Tasks Overview

1. **0-select_states.py**
   - Simple SELECT query using `MySQLdb` to fetch all states from a database.

2. **1-filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query with a specific state name filter using `MySQLdb`.

3. **2-my_filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query using user input with safe handling using `MySQLdb`.

4. **3-my_safe_filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query with safe handling of user inputs using `MySQLdb`.

5. **4-cities_by_state.py**
   - JOIN operation to fetch cities associated with states using `MySQLdb`.

6. **5-filter_cities.py**
   - SELECT query to filter cities based on state name using `MySQLdb`.

7. **6-model_state.py** to **11-model_state_insert.py**
   - Tasks involving SQLAlchemy ORM for creating, fetching, and manipulating state records.

## Files Present

- `0-select_states.py` to `11-model_state_insert.py`: Python scripts for each task.
- `setup_mysql_dev.sql`: SQL script to set up the MySQL database for development.
- `README.md`: Project overview, tasks, and setup instructions.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Python Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup MySQL Database:**
   - Execute the `setup_mysql_dev.sql` script to create necessary tables and populate initial data.

## Getting Started

Each Python script (`0-select_states.py` to `11-model_state_insert.py`) contains instructions on how to run it, including any required arguments or configurations. Start by exploring each task sequentially to understand ORM techniques and MySQL interactions using both `MySQLdb` and SQLAlchemy.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the scripts to deepen your understanding of Python ORM and database interactions.

# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Project

Welcome to my Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project repository! This project is designed to deepen my understanding of ORM techniques using Python with MySQL databases. Below are the tasks and files included in this repository:

## Tasks Overview

1. **0-select_states.py**
   - Simple SELECT query using `MySQLdb` to fetch all states from a database.

2. **1-filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query with a specific state name filter using `MySQLdb`.

3. **2-my_filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query using user input with safe handling using `MySQLdb`.

4. **3-my_safe_filter_states.py**
   - SELECT query with safe handling of user inputs using `MySQLdb`.

5. **4-cities_by_state.py**
   - JOIN operation to fetch cities associated with states using `MySQLdb`.

6. **5-filter_cities.py**
   - SELECT query to filter cities based on state name using `MySQLdb`.

7. **6-model_state.py** to **11-model_state_insert.py**
   - Tasks involving SQLAlchemy ORM for creating, fetching, and manipulating state records.

## Files Present

- `0-select_states.py` to `11-model_state_insert.py`: Python scripts for each task.
- `setup_mysql_dev.sql`: SQL script to set up the MySQL database for development.
- `README.md`: Project overview, tasks, and setup instructions.

# ALX Higher Level Programming Unlocked!ðŸ˜Ž

Cpython and other higher level programming starts...  
Higher Level Programs are known for their Higher Levels of Abstraction. OOP - Object Oriented Programming you say.  

      This repository contains projects and exercises completed during the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on higher-level programming concepts. The content primarily involves Python, JavaScript, and SQL, emphasizing object-oriented programming, data structures, and other advanced programming paradigms.

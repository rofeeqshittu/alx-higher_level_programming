# JavaScript Warm-up

![Javascript Please just work](Javascript-535.png.jpeg)

## Description

This repository contains a series of JavaScript scripting tasks designed to help understand and master the basic concepts of the language. The tasks cover fundamental JavaScript topics including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more. These scripts will also serve as the foundation for adding dynamic features to our AirBnB project using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Project Structure

Each task is implemented as a separate JavaScript file within the `0x12-javascript-warm_up` directory. Below is a list of the tasks and their respective file names:

### Tasks

1. **First constant, first print** (`0-javascript_is_amazing.js`)
   - Prints "JavaScript is amazing" using a constant variable.

2. **3 languages** (`1-multi_languages.js`)
   - Prints three lines: "C is fun", "Python is cool", and "JavaScript is amazing".

3. **Arguments** (`2-arguments.js`)
   - Prints a message based on the number of arguments passed to the script.

4. **Value of my argument** (`3-value_argument.js`)
   - Prints the first argument passed to the script.

5. **Create a sentence** (`4-concat.js`)
   - Prints two arguments passed to it in the format: `<first argument> is <second argument>`.

6. **An Integer** (`5-to_integer.js`)
   - Prints "My number: <first argument converted to an integer>", or "Not a number" if it can't be converted.

7. **Loop to languages** (`6-multi_languages_loop.js`)
   - Prints three lines using an array of strings and a loop.

8. **I love C** (`7-multi_c.js`)
   - Prints "C is fun" `x` times where `x` is the first argument of the script.

9. **Square** (`8-square.js`)
   - Prints a square of `X` characters with the size specified by the first argument.

10. **Add** (`9-add.js`)
    - Prints the addition of two integers passed as arguments.

11. **Factorial** (`10-factorial.js`)
    - Computes and prints the factorial of the first argument.

12. **Second biggest!** (`11-second_biggest.js`)
    - Searches for and prints the second biggest integer among the arguments passed.

13. **Object** (`12-object.js`)
    - Updates the value of an object's property and prints it.

14. **Add file** (`13-add.js`)
    - Defines a function that returns the addition of two integers.
